My last WOD was Invoice1, which was to utilize expressions and variables in Javascript to display the invoice table with document.write. I had more trouble on this WOD compared to the past WODs because Javascript is still new to me so a lot of time went into looking back at the reading materials and screencast to understand what the instructions were asking of me. I also got stuck at creating the table because I forgot I could inspect a page so I had to look at the screencast. For me personally, I did not time myself my very first attempt at the WOD. This worked better for me because I did not feel the pressure of time and could take the time to better understand concepts. Similarly to before, I prepared the same way by making sure to do the reading and screencasts ahead of time so I have an idea of where to look for help if I get stuck. To be better prepared, I could have all the readings open on separate tabs so it is easier to find the correct reference when reading through the instructions. So next WOD I might try reading through all the instructions first and finding all references while Iâ€™m reading.

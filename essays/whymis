*Prompt: Why did I decide to major in MIS or take ITM 352?*

I was still in the process of exploring majors, when one of my professors at the Shidler College of Business introduced the Management Information Systems major. This event sparked some of my interest, thus I decided to learn more about the major, which includes the decision to enroll in ITM 352. In understanding how deeply integrated and continuously evolving technology is in our daily lives and in the business world, I hope to become more proficient in understanding and utilizing technology.
